# E-Commerce-Website

This is a basic E-Commerce Website using HTML5, CSS3, and JS. It is a demo project where I included photo slides and a list of products on the home page. For added functionality, I have used JS in order to be more responsive on other devices.

Sadly, this is only a home page and nothing is working as of now! But with time this will be updated and then it will look much better than the existing ones! 😶‍🌫️

I referred to https://www.codewithrandom.com/2023/03/15/ecommerce-website-using-html-css-and-javascript-simple-and-responsive-ecommerce-website/ for making this website. Hope you all will like it! :)
